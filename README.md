# DynamicProgramming

Dynamic Programming is a difficult topic. This repository will document my understanding of this topic. 
Hopefully it will be of some use to you.

## Dynamic Programming Overview
An overview of Dynamic Programming

#### What is Dynamic Programming?

"Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems with overlapping subproblems."[<sup>3</sup>][3]

#### How to idenfity a Dynamic Programming Problem
"The normal form of dynamic programming problem is to calculate the maximum or minimum"[<sup>1</sup>][1]


1. Find a recurrence relation
2. Create a recursive solution
3. Save underlying subproblems
4. Turn recursion into iterative loop
