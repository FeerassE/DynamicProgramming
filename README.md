# DynamicProgramming

Dynamic Programming is a difficult topic. This repository will document my understanding of this topic. 
Hopefully it will be of some use to you.

## Dynamic Programming Overview
Documents my understanding of Dynamic Programming.

#### How to idenfity a Dynamic Programming Problem
"The normal form of dynamic programming problem is to calculate the maximum or minimum"[https://labuladong.gitbook.io/algo-en/i.-dynamic-programming/analysisofdynamicprogramming] 

1. Find a recurrence relation
2. Create a recursive solution
3. Save underlying subproblems
4. Turn recursion into iterative loop
